  The comparison function must take an old and new object and return true if

  The identity of the returned object will only change on subsequent renders
  if the comparison function returns false; otherwise it will return the
  equivalent object from a previous render so that hooks that look for
  deps array changes will not detect a change.

  This function exists because useMemo, useEffect & company do not accept a
  custom comparator, so immutable equal-but-not-identical values retrigger
  these hooks unnecessarily. Use this hook on values you intend to include
  in a deps array.

  Example use:

     (let [v (useEquiv v =)
           m (react/useMemo #(some-expensive-fn v) #js[v])]
       ,,,)

  Note the comparison function runs during the render phase, so keep it fast.
